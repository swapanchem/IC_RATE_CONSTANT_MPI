You have to install gfortran, mpi and LAPACK/BLAS library for successfully running the code.

Before running the code you should have all the required data and files as described in the input_ic.txt file. 
According to your system you should have chnage the value of all the required data.
The all files should be kept in the same folder during the running of the code.

# Run the internal-conversion-rate-temp.f90 program using the following two commands

gfortran -c determinant_module_complex_IC.f90

# For running the code parallelly 

mpif90 -o internal-conversion-rate-temp.exe internal-conversion-rate-temp.f90 determinant_module_complex_IC.o -llapack -lblas   # in some cases it should be -lscalapack -lopenblas instead of -llapack -lblas

# Execute the program 
mpirun -n $number ./internal-conversion-rate-temp.exe   # $number should be replaced by the number of processors used 

# Collect the data
